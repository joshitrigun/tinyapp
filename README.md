How To Use TinyApp
Register/Login
Users must be logged in to create new links, view them, and edit them.

Just click Register on right top, put in your email and password, and you're good to go.

Create New Links, Edit them
Either click Create a New Short Link in My URLs page, or Create New URL on navigation bar.

Then simply enter the long URL you want to shorten.

Edit or Delete Short Links
In My URLs, you can edit/delete any link you own.

Use Your Short Link
The path to use any short link is /u/:shortLink. This will redirect you to the long URL.

You can also reach this by clicking edit on a link, and using the link corresponding to the short URL.
